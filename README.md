# Scavenge

Getting Started:
  - After cloning, open the project in Unity. There will be some errors saying missing packages. Open the package manager window and import the three tarballs that come with the Snapdragon Spaces SDK: SnapdragonSpaces_Package, QCHT_Core and QCHT_Interactions.

Issues:
- Sometimes clicking the buttons with the gaze pointer can be difficult.
- Deleting the markers doesn't work all the time. It seems if you stand still it sometimes does not work, but if you move again, it will work.
Bugs: 
- Distance Indicator UI not showing text during Update() in MapContoller. Distance is correctly displayed in logs.
