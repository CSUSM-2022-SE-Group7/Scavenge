# Scavenge

Issues:
- Sometimes clicking the buttons with the gaze pointer can be difficult.
- Deleting the markers doesn't work all the time. It seems if you stand still it sometimes does not work, but if you move again, it will work.
Bugs: 
- Distance Indicator UI not showing text during Update() in MapContoller. Distance is correctly displayed in logs.
