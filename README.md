# Scavenge

An Augmented Reality Scavenger Hunt made for CSUSM's Software Engineering B.S. Capstone course. This project was sponsored by Qualcomm, creators of the Snapdragon Spaces SDK for their mobile phone processors. The HMD for this project was the Lenovo ThinkReality A3 glassess.

## Set Up
In order for the project to build, you will have to import the Snapdragon Spaces 0.11 SDK found within the tree under `\Snapdragon_Spaces_SDK_for_Unity_0_11_1\UnityPackage\SnapdragonSpaces_Package_0_11_1.tgz`. 

## Game 
Themed as a paranoia-inducing horror scavenger hunt for souls, we did our best to create a gaming experience in the spirit of fun.
